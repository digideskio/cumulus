# Cumulus

Cumulus is a deployment tool used to deploy and maintain environments built with AWS CloudFormation. Cumulus will help you bundle your code and configuration and unpack the bundle to new instances on CloudFormation.

## Basic concepts

Cumulus is built around three main concepts:

- An **environment** references a whole environment and all it's CF stacks. It holds together information about the AWS account, which stacks to deploy and in which version.
- A **stack** is simply a CloudFormation stack.
- And a **bundle** is a `tar.bz2` file with code and configuration to unpack to instances.

## Requirements

Cumulus requires Python 2.7 and `boto`. Please install requirements with

    sudo pip install -r cumulus/requirements.txt

## Configuration

### Cumulus configuration

All configuration is read form `/etc/cumulus.conf`, `~/.cumulus.conf` and , `./cumulus.conf` in order. This is an example configuration:

    [environment: stage]
    access-key-id: <AWS ACCESS KEY>
    secret-access-key: <AWS SECRET KEY>
    bucket: se.skymill.bundles
    region: eu-west-1
    stacks: full
    bundles: webserver, database
    version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    pre-deploy-hook: /path/to/script
    post-deploy-hook: echo "Yay" > ~/test.log

    [stack: full]
    template: /Users/sebastian/tmp/hosts/webserver.json
    disable-rollback: true
    parameters:
        version = 1.1.0,
        test tag=my test value ,
         key= value

    [bundle: webserver]
    pre-bundle-hook: git clone git://git.example.com/my.git
    post-bundle-hook: rm -rf my
    paths:
        /Users/sebastian/tmp/hosts/webserver,
        /Users/sebastian/tmp/code/wordpress

    [bundle: database]
    pre-bundle-hook: /path/to/script
    paths: /Users/sebastian/tmp/hosts/database

All configuration options are required to be set except `parameters` for bundles.

### CloudFormation configuration

To save some space in this document, please find the example AWS CloudFormation template [here](https://github.com/skymill/cumulus/blob/master/cumulus/docs/cloudformation-template-example.json)

## Deployment workflow

All you need to do is to run the command below. This will bundle and upload all your software to AWS S3. It will then trigger an create or update at AWS CloudFormation.

    cumulus --environment production --deploy

## Environment specific configuration

To have files that should only be included in specific environments, prefix them with `__cumulus-environment__filename`. So for example: `__cumulus-production__nginx.conf` is the `nginx.conf` for the `production` environment.
