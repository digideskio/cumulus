Cumulus Bundle Handler
======================

The Cumulus Bundle Handle is a Python script that should reside on each server
in the environment. The script is responsible for

* Downloading and extracting the correct bundles for the host
* Running pre and post deployment scripts on the host, e.g. to restart
relevant services and trigger various deployment hooks

The bundles are generated via the ``cumulus`` command (or in your build server)
and uploaded to S3. Cumulus Bundle Handler will then download the bundle when
the script is triggered (usually by a CloudFormation ``create`` or ``update``).

Init scripts
------------

The Cumulus Bundle Handler supports scripts to be executed:

* Before bundle extraction (good for stopping services etc)
* After bundle extraction (good for starting services)
* Both before and after extraction (typically cleaning jobs)

All init script should reside in ``/etc/cumulus-init.d`` on Linux systems and
in ``C:\cumulus\init.d`` on Windows systems and must be executable.

* Scripts starting with ``K`` (capital K) are executed *before* the bundle is
extracted
* Scripts starting with ``S`` (capital S) are executed *after* the bundle is
extracted
* Scripts starting with anything else than ``S`` or ``K`` are executed both
before and after the bundle is extracted

Configuration file
------------------

The configuration file for Cumulus Bundle Handler should reside on your
EC2 instances under ``/etc/cumulus/metadata.conf`` on Linux systems and
under ``C:\cumulus\conf\metadata.conf`` on Windows systems. It recommended
to serve it to that location using CloudFormation `AWS::CloudFormation::Init <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-init.html#aws-resource-init-files>`_.


``metadata.conf`` example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Cumulus Bundle Handler relies on a configuration file called
``metadata.conf``. Here's an example configuration file.
::

    [metadata]
    log-level: INFO
    access-key-id: <AWS_ACCESS_KEY>
    secret-access-key: <AWS_SECRET_KEY>
    region: eu-west-1
    bundle-bucket: com.example.bundles
    environment: stage
    bundle-types: webserver
    bundle-extraction-paths:
        generic -> /etc/example
        webserver -> /
    version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Logging
-------

Cumulus Bundle Handler will log to ``/var/log/cumulus-bundle-handler.log`` on
Linux systems and to ``C:\cumulus\logs\cumulus-bundle-handler.log`` on Windows
systems.

This log file can be really helpful when trying to debug your deployments.
