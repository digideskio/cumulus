Cumulus Bundle Handler
======================

The **Cumulus Bundle Handler (CBH)** is a Python script that should reside on each host in the system. The script is responsible for

* Downloading and extracting the correct bundles for the host
* Running pre and post deployment scripts on the host

The bundles are generated via the ``cumulus`` command and uploaded to S3. CBH will then download the bundle when the script is triggered (usually by a CloudFormation ``create`` or ``update``).


Init scripts
------------
The Cumulus Bundle Handler supports scripts to be executed:

* Before bundle extraction (good for stopping services etc)
* After bundle extraction (good for starting services)
* Both before and after extraction (typically cleaning jobs)

All init script should reside in ``/etc/cumulus-init.d`` and must be executable.

* Scripts starting with ``K`` (capital K) are executed *before* the bundle is extracted.
* Scripts starting with ``S`` (capital S) are executed *after* the bundle is extracted.
* Scripts starting with anything else than ``S`` or ``K`` are executed *both before and after* the bundle is extracted.


Configuration
-------------
This configuration should reside on your EC2 instances under ``/etc/cumulus/metadata.conf``. It is good practice to serve it to that location using CloudFormation `AWS::CloudFormation::Init <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-init.html#aws-resource-init-files>`_.
