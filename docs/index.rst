Cumulus
=======

Cumulus is a deployment suite used to deploy and maintain environments built
with AWS CloudFormation. Cumulus will help you bundle your code and
configuration and unpack the bundle to new instances on CloudFormation.

Supported platforms
-------------------

* Cumulus supports Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
* Cumulus Bundle Handler supports Linux and Windows (and likely Mac OS X,
but testing is needed)

The rest of the work is down within the AWS CloudFormation template. Please have a look at our :ref:`cloudformation-template-example`.
